 <h4> <section> The Sport of Quail Hunting </h4>
 <p>  The modern sport of quail hunting originated when European settlers came to North America. The sport became very popular in the 20th century due to the abundance of quail across the United States. The quail is a ground-dwelling bird so hunters must use a variety of hunting dogs to have a successful hunt. At Quail Harvest Hunt Club, we use a combination of pointers and retrievers. The pointers, usually breeds like German Shorthair Pointers or Britney Spaniels, run through the woods around the hunting party, using their noses to locate the quail. Once they have located the birds, they will point them allowing the hunters enough time to get in position. Two shooters will step up on either side of one of our professional guides. The idea of only having two shooters at a time minimizes the risk of any accidents occuring. Then, when the hunters are ready, the guide will send the retriever to flush the quail. The retrievers used in quail hunting are a variety of breeds, but the most common at Quail Harvest are Labrador Retrievers or Boykin Spaniels. The retriever will run to where the other dog is pointing and scare the quail into flight, where the hunters have a chance to shoot. The combination of fast pace shooting and watching the different dogs work makes quail hunting one of the most exciting types of hunting sports. </p>
